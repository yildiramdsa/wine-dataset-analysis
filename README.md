# Wine Dataset Analysis

## What is the count and percentage of high-quality wines (wines with a quality rating of >7) for red and white wine types, as well as the overall percentage of high-quality wines relative to the total wine dataset?

**Count of High-Quality Wines**:

* Red Wine: 17 high-quality wines.
* White Wine: 136 high-quality wines.

**Percentage of High-Quality Wines by Wine Type**:

* Red Wine: 1.25% of red wine samples.
* White Wine: 3.43% of white wine samples.

**Overall Percentage of High-Quality Wines**: High-quality wines make up 2.88% of the total dataset; 97.12% are low-quality wines.

## How do the average values of features differ between high-quality and low-quality wines for both red and white wine types?

**Alcohol Content**: A key differentiator for both wine types, with **higher levels in high-quality wines**.

**Sulfur Dioxide**: **High-quality wines** generally have **lower levels**, indicating better natural processing.

## How does the alcohol content distribution vary between high-quality and low-quality wines for red and white wine types? What are the differences in total sulfur dioxide content distribution between high-quality and low-quality wines for red and white wine types?

The **alcohol content distribution for high-quality wines** is **slightly left-skewed**, with most values concentrated in the upper range, suggesting a correlation between higher alcohol levels and better quality. In contrast, **low-quality wines** exhibit a **right-skewed distribution**, with most samples clustered in the lower alcohol ranges.

**High-quality wines** have a **narrower, more symmetric distribution for total sulfur dioxide**, indicating a more consistent range of values. **Low-quality wines** display a **right-skewed distribution**, especially white wines, with a significant number of samples in the higher sulfur dioxide range.
